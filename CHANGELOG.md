# Changelog

## [1.1.2]
### Added
- New due date filters for `dueAfter` and `dueBefore` to narrow results to a specific window or day
- Support for fetching and embedding a Linear issue by its ID using a code block (`id: ISSUE_ID`).
  - Example:
    ````markdown
    ```linear
    id: LIN-123
    ```
    ````
  - You can also use `issueId` as the key.
  - This allows you to reference or embed individual issues from your team's projects directly into your Obsidian notes.
- Support for fetching and embedding multiple Linear issues by their IDs using a code block (`ids:` YAML array).
  - Example:
    ````markdown
    ```linear
    ids:
      - LIN-123
      - LIN-456
      - LIN-789
    ```
    ````
  - Each listed issue will be fetched and rendered in the order provided.
