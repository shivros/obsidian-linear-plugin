# Linear Plugin for Obsidian

This plugin integrates Linear (https://linear.app) with Obsidian (https://obsidian.md), allowing you to embed and filter Linear issues directly in your notes.

**Note: This plugin is currently desktop-only and does not support mobile devices.**

## Features

### Display Options

You can customize how issues are displayed using YAML options in the code block:

#### Limit Number of Issues

To limit the number of issues displayed, use the `limit` option:

```linear
limit: 5
```

This will show only the 5 most recent issues. If no limit is specified, all issues will be displayed.

#### Filter by Team

To show issues from a specific team, use the `team` option with the team's name:

```linear
team: Engineering
```

#### Filter by Status

To show issues with a specific status, use the `status` option with the status name:

```linear
status: In Progress
```

The status name matching is case-insensitive and forgiving of special characters, so "inprogress" and "In Progress" will work the same way.

#### Filter by Assignee

To show issues assigned to a specific person, use the `assignee` option with their email address:

```linear
assignee: user@example.com
```

#### Sort by Due Date

To sort issues by their due date, use the `sorting` option:

```linear
sorting: dateascending   # Sort by due date, oldest first
sorting: datedescending  # Sort by due date, newest first
```

#### Hide Description

To show only issue titles without descriptions, use the `hideDescription` option:

```linear
hideDescription: true
```

#### Select Integration

If you have multiple Linear integrations configured, choose which one to use with the `integration` option:

```linear
integration: work
```

If this option is omitted, the plugin uses your default integration.

### Combining Options

You can combine multiple options to create specific views:

```linear
team: Engineering
status: In Progress
assignee: user@example.com
sorting: dateascending
hideDescription: true
limit: 3
```

This will show the 3 oldest In Progress issues from the Engineering team that are assigned to the specified user, without descriptions.

### Visual Enhancements

#### Due Date Indicators

Issues display due dates with color-coded badges and emoji indicators:
- 📅 Due Today (orange)
- 📅 Due Tomorrow (blue)
- ⚠️ Overdue (red)
- 📅 Upcoming (green)
- 📅 No due date (gray)

#### Status Colors

Each status is displayed with a color-coded badge matching your Linear workflow states.

### Debug Mode

The plugin includes a debug mode that can be enabled in settings. When enabled, it provides comprehensive logging (prefixed with 🔄) in the developer console, helping you troubleshoot:
- Plugin initialization and settings changes
- API requests and responses
- Filter applications and option parsing
- Due date calculations
- Status matching
- Team identification
- Description rendering decisions

To use debug mode:
1. Open Obsidian Settings
2. Go to Community Plugins > Linear
3. Enable the "Debug Mode" toggle
4. Open the developer console (Ctrl+Shift+I or Cmd+Option+I)
5. Look for messages prefixed with 🔄

Debug logs are only shown when debug mode is enabled, keeping your console clean during normal operation.

### Error Handling

The plugin includes comprehensive error handling:
- Detailed error messages showing both team and status context
- Graceful fallback for invalid status names
- Automatic status name normalization
- Cache management for workflow states
- Clear distinction between expected conditions and actual errors
